Instructions on how to run OSINT Script


######

1. ++++ YOU MUST DO THIS ++++ - Change the tool variables (under section 'Tool Paths') so each tool will use your local paths.

2. LinkedIn2Username requires you to be previously logged in and will require your password upon start. Main reason this runs first. 

3. Where ever you start this script will be the top level directory. Sub folders and files will be created at this location

4. If looking to run a more advanced scan with 'DNSenum' ensure the 'subdomains-top1million-5000.txt' (from seclist) is located in the following directory: '/usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/DNS/'. Otherwise change the wordlist file within the script to the directory of your chosing. 

5. DNSenum will take a pretty good amount of time to complete. Just FYI
